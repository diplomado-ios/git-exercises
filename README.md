## String Interpolation Exercise
Create a variable in the playground representing Mexico City elevation (2,240 m). Which data type should you use for each one? Give this variable a value and use string interpolation to print the following message to the console "Mexico City has an elevation of 2240 m".

## Arrays
You have an array like the one below
```swift
var myToDoList = ["Take out the trash", "Pay bills", "Cross off finished items"]
```
 
Use the documentation to find a property defined on the Array type that will tell you whether myToDoList
contains any elements. Print `true` in the console if it contains any element and `false` if it doesn't contain any element.
